# This action runs depends on configured pre-commit settings in
# the caller workflow. It runs just one hook: terraform-docs and
# passes if there are no changes or fails if it detects changes
# to write to the README files. This should always pass if the 
# developer of the caller repo is using the pre-commit hooks.
